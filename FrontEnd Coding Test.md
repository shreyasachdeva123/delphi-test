1. Group 1 must have the website's titles displayed and an area that is initially hidden but when the user clicks on the website title, the hidden area is visible and it has a description of the title the user clicked on and there is a website link after the description. Descriptions are short 1 to 2 sentences and must be written by you.
1. Group 2 must have an area where the logo of the company is displayed when the user hovers over the specific link. This must not cause the dashboard to expand in height or width. You must research and find the appropriate logos.
1. Group 3 links must be able to be hidden by the user at the click of a button and able to view again by clicking the same button. The title should remain visible at all times.
